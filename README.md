## Scholar Ignore
Scholar Ignore is a simple Firefox extension that hides specific papers in search results for Google Scholar. The main idea is that as you look through papers, you will read them, save them where appropriate and organize them in a research organization program. Once you organize papers you don't need to see them again for the same project. This extension will help declutter your search results.  
  
#### Projects
The extension is organized by projects. To create a project:
1. Click on the extension icon in the browser bar.
2. In the text box write your project name
3. Click "Add Project"
4. To set the project as active project click the "Select" button under the project name
  
You can also remove a project with the "Remove" button under the project name  
  
#### Scholar Page
This extension hides results from google scholar, however, this does not change the number of items returned per page. So if everything on a page returned from a search is in the ignore list then the page will be blank.  
To add a page to the list
1. Make sure that you select a project on the extension
2. Click the "Add to List" button under the search result.

The page will now be added to the list and removed from view.  
To view the list of papers on the ignore list, click the extension icon on the browser bar and the list of papers will be under the "Papers" heading.
You can remove a paper from the list with the "Remove" button, the paper will now be visible again after the page reloads.
