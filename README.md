## Scholar Ignore
Scholar Ignore is a simple Firefox extension that hides specific papers in search results for Google Scholar. The main idea is that as you look through papers, you will read them, save them where appropriate and organize them in a research organization program. Once you organize papers you don't need to see them again for the same project. This extension will help declutter your search results.  
  
#### Projects
The extension is organized by projects. To create a project:

#### Scholar Page
This extension hides results from google scholar, however, this does not change the number of items returned per page. So if everything on a page returned from a search is in the ignore list then the page will be empty.  
To add a page to the list
1. Make sure that you select a project on the extension
