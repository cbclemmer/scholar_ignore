## Scholar Ignore

Scholar Ignore is a simple Firefox extension that hides specific papers in search results for Google Scholar. The main idea is that as you look through papers, you will read them, save them where appropriate and organize them in a research organization program. Once you organize papers you don't need to see them again for the same project. This extension will help declutter your search results.
